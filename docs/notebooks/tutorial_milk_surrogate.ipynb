    "## Define cost function using MILK\n",
    "\n",
    "In our prior problems, we defined a cost function to optimize which was a simple Python function.\n",
    "For using a program like MAUD which writes files to disk we need to make sure each optimizer has its own directory set up for itself.\n",
    "Otherwise different optimizers would be overwriting each other in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we are going to create a slightly more complicated cost function using the ``AbstractFunction`` class from Mystic.\n",
    "The analagous function to our prior cost functions is ``CostFunction.function`` below.\n",
    "Our ``CostFunction.function`` calls ``CostFunction.initialize`` and ``CostFunction.cost_function``.\n",
    "\n",
    "MILK will want to setup a directory with files that are read by MAUD.\n",
    "This is only called once at the beginning.\n",
    "Therefore, there is an ``CostFunciton.initialize`` function which is called once at the very beginning of an optimization.\n",
    "This ``initialize`` simply sets up the directory (e.g. copy needed files).\n",
    "We name the directory after the processor's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is the ``CostFunction.cost_function`` which sets the lattice parameters using MILK, does a refinement step, and returns the R-factor.\n",
    "This is called for every parameter set in the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note, you will need to make one change below.**\n",
    "You will need to change the path to the ``template.par`` file that is being copied below.\n",
    "It will exist from the MILK tutorial.\n",
    "You'd really want to pass this as an attribute on the class but for the sake of brevity we will edit the line here in place."

    "## Finding the starting lattice parameters of a Rietveld analysis by optimizing a surrogate model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior page of the tutorial, we went over how to find the global minimum of using a surrogate model.\n",
    "Recall, that we constructed an interpolated model using the ``InterpModel`` and then minimized until our surrogate and cost function reached <0.001 difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to Rietveld analysis, the global minimum is the best fit parameters for our data.\n",
    "Below, we follow the same pattern using ``InterpModel`` to create an interpolated surrogate model.\n",
    "In the ``while`` loop we continuously update the surrogate model, find the minimum of the surrogate model, then evaluate that minimum using our actual cost function (``CostFunction.function`` above) using MILK, and continue until we are below a threshold of agreement between the surrogate model and the actual cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, we introduced this approach because we were able to find a minimum with fewer calls to the actual cost function.\n",
    "In this case, a call to MILK may take several seconds and in an optimization algorithm calling that hundreds or thousands of times, the time can be hours."
